## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on UML Mentor, an interactive web app designed to help students' master UML diagrams through practical challenges. Users upload their diagram solutions and our AI provides instant feedback guiding them towards improvement and deeper understanding!
- 💼 Previously worked at AppLab, where I developed chatbots leveraging OpenAI/Azure technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Node.js. I am a passionate learner eager to apply my knowledge in real-world projects.
- 💬 Ask me anything about AI, chatbots, graph theory, or why my code works perfectly at 3 AM but breaks during demos 😁
- 📫 How to reach me: email is best!
- 🔍 Fun Fact: I have quite a bit of experiance in developing chatbots
