## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on UML Mentor, an interactive web app designed to help students' master UML diagrams through practical challenges. Users upload their diagram solutions and our AI provides instant feedback guiding them towards improvement and deeper understanding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Node.js. I am a passionate learner eager to apply my knowledge in real-world projects.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on web development, AI, or any intersection of computer science and mathematics.
- 💬 Ask me anything about algorithms, graph theory, or why my code works perfectly at 3 AM but breaks during demos 😁
- 📫 How to reach me: email is best!
